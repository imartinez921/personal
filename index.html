										<div class="nav-submenu-link">
											<p>Coding brings to life a childlike part of me who was creative, curious, and determined to express herself
											virtually when she didnâ€™t have the freedom before to do so in real life. She loves being stubborn in figuring out how I can
											make the computer act in the way that I want.</p>

										<div class="nav-submenu-link">
											The pandemic was a crucial time for all of us. While some of the workforce began to WFH, as a pharmacist &
											pharmacy
											manager for Walgreens I never stopped working. When the COVID-19 vaccines were approved at the end of 2020,
											I spent the
											next 5 months feeling like I was saving the world. But at the same time, I was in survival mode â€“ skipping
											my lunch
											breaks, working up to 16h a day to make a dent in the workload.... There were simply too many people relying
											on me;
											even if I had to work alone, I showed up anyway. I asked corporate for more hands on deck or a modified
											schedule, but I
											didn't stop or slow down when aid wasn't given to me.... Then in March 2021, when I was scheduled to work 11
											days in a row, I finally had a panic attack at work on the 9th
											day. I told myself that I would wait for it to happen again before I would consider leaving my job, but in
											the months following, I began making mistakes in the prescriptions I was checking. I had to come
											to terms with the fact that I was here to help people, but because I was burned out & not mentally well, my
											next mistake could hurt someone. I resigned 2 months later, in June 2021.</div>

									<a href="#faq3" class="nav-link">But why did I leave pharmacy all together?</a>
									<div id="faq3" class="nav-submenu">
										<div class="nav-submenu-link">Turning 29 after my resignation was a true reckoning for me. Not only was I doing
											therapy to help me understand my
											exhaustion & anxiety, but I was coming to terms
											with the fact that I had always lived my entire life for others, and it would kill me if I continued. I
											resolved that my first step to learning how to assert boundaries
											would be never putting myself in that kind of all-sacrificing position again. Unfortunately, this meant
											that I didn't
											see a future for myself in the U.S. healthcare system,
											especially because my sole motivation in pharmacy had been talking and teaching patients.</div>

									<a href="#faq4" class="nav-link">So how did I find software engineering?</a>
									<div id="faq4" class="nav-submenu">
										<div class="nav-submenu-link">It has been an emotional, meaningful journey to get here. My therapist asked me to think of what came naturally to me as
										a child (before I had internalized an identity),
										and what came to mind was writing & fiddling with computers. Before high school, I was obsessed with getting the right
										fonts and colors for the song lyrics on my Myspace page. I would procrastinate on my pre-pharmacy
										studies for hours just because my Tumblr theme didn't look
										exactly how I wanted it. When my 2011 Macbook Pro started failing during pharmacy school, I replaced the hard drive with an SSD. (This ultimately ended up being the computer I completed bootcamp with!) Unfortunately, no one at that time ever told me that computers or technology could be a career. Fortunately,
										the pandemic had revealed SWE as a booming field, and I had many SWE friends who encouraged me that I could do this. In April 2022, I decided to sit in for App Academy's pre-bootcamp 
										(for ground zero learners), knowing I could leave any day in the first week.... But I never did. I enrolled in their in-person cohort a month later
										and graduated the day after my 30th birthday in September 2022.

									<div id="faq5" class="nav-submenu">
										<div class="nav-submenu-link">Doing well! With the market as bad as it has been since I graduated, I decided to bide my time as I recovered from the intensity of bootcamp. 
											Nowadays, I code upwards of 6-8 hours a day at home, sometimes group projects and sometimes solo projects, while still taking time for self-reflection and self-care. I find myself able to handle much more stress than I did before bootcamp,
											and I'm excited to start working again in 2024. I have a pipe dream of working for a company whose mission is creating technology that will help healthcare providers take better care of their patients
											& daily workload (ask me in an interview how technology impacted my work as a frontline worker during the pandemic ðŸ« ) but I am open to any opportunity that will help me grow as a developer.
